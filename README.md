# pure-java-leaderboard
Pure Java Leaderboard is a thin leaderboard implementation using pure java (no Redis, no other tools)

you can run the tests with 'mvn test'.

All you need in order to use that is to create your own Rankable object and you're good to go.

This is a first draft, I'll add more features and documentation in the near future.

One major upgrade planned is shared memory support. Coming soon :)

Feel free to suggest ways to improve it!

Thanks!
